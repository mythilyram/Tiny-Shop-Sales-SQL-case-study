# Tiny-Shop-Sales-SQL-case-study

Conquered a challenging SQL case study in PostgreSQL, navigating diverse SQL techniques including 
ğŸ”¹Common Table Expressions (CTE), 
ğŸ”¹Fundamental aggregations, 
ğŸ”¹Applying CASE WHEN statements, 
ğŸ”¹Wielding the power of date-time functions and 
ğŸ”¹Advanced window functions. ğŸ’ª
 
I'm excited to share my experience with the "Tiny Shop Sales Overview" case study through the Data In Motion platform,
and this project offered the perfect chance to put multiple SQL concepts into action, extracting valuable insights from the data.
 
Here's a glimpse of my accomplishments:
ğŸ”¹ Unearthed the product with the highest price.
ğŸ”¹ Discovered the customer with the most orders.
ğŸ”¹ Calculated total revenue per product.
ğŸ”¹ Found the day with the highest revenue.
ğŸ”¹ Identified the first order for each customer.
ğŸ”¹ Spotted the top 3 customers ordering the most distinct products.
ğŸ”¹ Determined the product with the lowest quantity sold.
ğŸ”¹ Uncovered the median order total.
ğŸ”¹ Classified orders as 'Expensive,' 'Affordable,' or 'Cheap.'
ğŸ”¹ Located customers indulging in the highest-priced product.

Mastery of CTE was just one facet of this SQL adventure, fueling my passion for extracting valuable data insights! ğŸ“ˆğŸ’¡
