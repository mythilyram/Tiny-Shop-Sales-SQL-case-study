# Tiny-Shop-Sales-SQL-case-study

Conquered a challenging SQL case study in PostgreSQL, navigating diverse SQL techniques including 

ðŸ”¹Common Table Expressions (CTE), 

ðŸ”¹Fundamental aggregations, 

ðŸ”¹Applying CASE WHEN statements, 

ðŸ”¹Wielding the power of date-time functions and 

ðŸ”¹Advanced window functions. ðŸ’ª
 
I'm excited to share my experience with the "Tiny Shop Sales Overview" case study through the Data In Motion platform,
and this project offered the perfect chance to put multiple SQL concepts into action, extracting valuable insights from the data.
 
Here's a glimpse of my accomplishments:

ðŸ”¹ [Unearthed the product with the highest price.](https://github.com/mythilyram/Tiny-Shop-Sales-SQL-case-study/blob/main/Q1.png)

ðŸ”¹ Discovered the customer with the most orders.- [Using Joins and aggregate](https://github.com/mythilyram/Tiny-Shop-Sales-SQL-case-study/blob/main/Q1.png),  [Using CTE and RANK()](https://github.com/mythilyram/Tiny-Shop-Sales-SQL-case-study/blob/main/Q2%20using%20CTE%20and%20Rank%20fn.png)
